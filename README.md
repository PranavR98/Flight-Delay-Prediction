# Flight-Delay-Prediction

● Aim of this project was to determine the delay in the arrival and departure of flights given a set of external conditions.
● The system consisted of an XG-Booster Regressor which was fed with a dataset comprising of various flight data from
various airports in the United States during April – October 2013.
● Keeping in mind all the various factors which affected the airport, the classifier was used to predict a delay in the
arrival and departure of different flights which eventually ensured passenger satisfaction.
